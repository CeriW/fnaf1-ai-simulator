# How sound works in Five Nights At Freddy's

The details contained within are taken from [this Youtube video by Scruffy](https://youtu.be/1yTIhtfgDwY) as well as my own experience playing the game

The audio in FNAF 1 can be split into three categories:

- Advantageous - audio that gives you clues and information
- Middle ground - audio that doesn't necessarily give you information, but does play as a direct result of something happening. Predictable, logical.
- Detrimental audio - at best is purely for ambience, and at worst meant to mislead, distract or scare you

## Advantageous audio

### Oven

[oven-1.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-1.mp3)  
[oven-2.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-2.mp3)  
[oven-3.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-3.mp3)  
[oven-4.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-4.mp3)

A random one of these will play when Chica is in the kitchen, even when the camera is off (albeit quieter). This way you can tell Chica is in the kitchen without needing to find her on the cameras.

### Freddy

[freddy-move-1.mp3](../assets/sounds/freddy-move-1.mp3)  
[freddy-move-2.mp3](../assets/sounds/freddy-move-2.mp3)  
[freddy-move-3.mp3](../assets/sounds/freddy-move-3.mp3)

One of these sounds, chosen randomly each time, will play each time Freddy moves. Freddy is difficult to see on camera and always follows a set patch, so if you pay attention it can actually be easier to keep track of Freddy by counting how many times he's laughed rather than finding him on the cameras.

## Middle ground

- [animatronic-camera-move.mp3](../assets/sounds/animatronic-camera-move.mp3) plays if an animatronic on the screen you're looking at moves
- [foxy-run.mp3](../assets/sounds/foxy-run.mp3) plays when you are watching Foxy run down the hall at you
- [foxy-door-bash.mp3](../assets/sounds/foxy-door-bash.mp3) plays when Foxy is banging on your door after having run down the hall
- [camera-toggle.mp3](../assets/sounds/camera-toggle.mp3) plays when you turn the cameras on/off
- [doorway-warning.mp3](../assets/sounds/doorway-warning.mp3) plays when a light reveals an animatronic in your doorway
- [error.mp3](../assets/sounds/error.mp3) plays when you click a door/light button but it doesn't work because the animatronic is in your office already
- [jumpscare.mp3](../assets/sounds/jumpscare.mp3) VOLUME WARNING - plays when an animatronic who is not Golden Freddy finally jumpscares you
- [post-jumpscare.mp3](../assets/sounds/post-jumpscare.mp3) static sound plays immediately after a non-Golden Freddy jumpscare on the game over screen
- [jumpscare-golden-freddy.mp3](../assets/sounds/jumpscare-golden-freddy.mp3) VOLUME WARNING - plays if Golden Freddy jumpscares you
- [6AM.mp3](../assets/sounds/6AM.mp3) plays if you successfully reach 6AM
- [cheer.mp3](../assets/sounds/cheer.mp3) plays over the top of 6AM.mp3 a few seconds in

## Detrimental audio

Detrimental audio can be split into three subcategories:

- "Muddied" information - sound that makes it harder to hear more useful audio clues
- Red herrings - sound like they should mean something but they don't
- Pure horror - these sounds mean absolutely nothing. Their sole purpose is to mess with your head

### "Muddied" information

- [office-fan.mp3](../assets/sounds/office-fan.mp3) plays ALL of the time. Even when you are in the cameras (although it's quieter then). It is important that this sound effect is louder than most of the other sound effects - it is intended to stress the player by making other sounds harder to hear.
- [camera-toggle-off.mp3](../assets/sounds/camera-toggle-off.mp3) plays when the cameras are turned off
- [camera-toggle-on.mp3](../assets/sounds/camera-toggle-on.mp3) plays when the cameras are turned on
- [camera-change.mp3](../assets/sounds/camera-change.mp3) plays when you move to a different camera
- [camera-feed.mp3](../assets/sounds/camera-toggle.mp3) plays when you are looking at a camera
- [garble-1.mp3](../assets/sounds/garble-1.mp3) [garble-2.mp3](../assets/sounds/garble-2.mp3) [garble-3.mp3](../assets/sounds/garble-1.mp3) can play when you are looking at a camera

### Red herrings

- [eerie.mp3](../assets/sounds/eerie.mp3) Barely audible under the fan. Plays sometimes
- [circus.mp3](../assets/sounds/circus.mp3) pipe organ with no meaning
- [pirate-song.mp3](../assets/sounds/pirate-song.mp3) is louder when viewing Pirate Cove, indicating it comes from Foxy, but means absolutely nothing in regards to Foxy's behaviour

### Pure horror

- [robot-voice.mp3](../assets/sounds/robot-voice.mp3) will play if you are viewing Bonnie/Chica in 2B/4B while they are playing their glitch camera animation. This only happens on night 3+
- [breath-1.mp3](../assets/sounds/breath-1.mp3) [breath-2.mp3](../assets/sounds/breath-2.mp3) [breath-3.mp3](../assets/sounds/breath-3.mp3) [breath-4.mp3](../assets/sounds/breath-4.mp3) will play if Bonnie/Chica are in your office but you've got the cameras up
- [power-outage.mp3](../assets/sounds/power-outage.mp3) plays when you run out of power
- [toreador-march.mp3](../assets/sounds/power-outage.mp3) plays when Freddy is at your door after having run out of power
- Complete silence - there's no sound effect for this. It's just worth noting that in the gap between the toreador march and Freddy's jumpscare, there is complete silence.

## Phone Guy - a bit of all three

'Phone guy', as called by the fans, is a pre-recorded phone call the user receives at the beginning of each night. As the game progresses these move from arguably advantageous audio (giving you vague but helpful information) into detrimental audio, covering the full range of muddied information (making it harder to hear audio clues), red herrings (giving you misleading or flat out wrong information), to pure horror (the completely garbled message of night 5). The game gives you the option to mute these after they have started.
